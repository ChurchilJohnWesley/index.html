                <p><br/> 1. What is a C      omputer?
                    <br/>A computer is an electronic device that processes data, 
                    <br/>performing tasks according to a set of instructions called a program. It can store, retrieve, 
                    <br/>and manipulate data.
                
                   <h3 style="color: cornflowerblue;">Components of a Computer:</h3> 
                <br/>-Hardware: The physical parts of a computer.
                <br/>-Software: The programs and applications that run on the hardware.
                
                   <h4 style="color: blueviolet;">2. Types of Computers</h4>

                   <br/>a. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
               <br/> - The brain of the computer where most calculations take place.
                <br/>- Measured in gigahertz (GHz), indicating how many instructions it can process per second.
                
                    <br/>b. Memory (RAM)
               <br/> - Temporary storage that the CPU uses to hold data for currently running programs.
               <br/> - More RAM allows for more applications to run simultaneously.
                
                   <br/>c. Storage Devices
               <br/> -Hard Disk Drive (HDD): Traditional storage device that uses spinning disks.
               <br/> -Solid State Drive (SSD): Faster and more reliable storage that uses flash memory.
                
                    <br/>d. Motherboard
               <br/> - The main circuit board that connects all components of the computer.
                
                    <br/>e. Input Devices
                <br/>- Devices that allow users to input data, such as:
                 <br/> -Keyboard
                 <br/>-Mouse
                 <br/> -Scanner
                
                                <br/>f. Output Devices
                    <br/> - Devices that output data from the computer, such as:
                    <br/> -Monitor
                    <br/>-Printer
                    <br/> -Speakers
